# devhub-week2-security-fixes
Week 2 – Security Fixes for my Cybersecurity Internship at DevelopersHub. Implemented input validation, password hashing, JWT authentication, and secure headers.

## 📌 Overview
In Week 2, I implemented security measures on the user management system to fix vulnerabilities identified in Week 1.  
The fixes included input validation, password hashing, JWT authentication, and HTTP header security.

## 🛠️ Fixes Implemented
- **Validator.js** → Input sanitization & validation
- **bcrypt** → Secure password hashing
- **jsonwebtoken (JWT)** → Token-based authentication
- **Helmet.js** → Secure HTTP headers
- 

##  Deliverables

## ✅ Summary
- Weak input validation fixed with `validator`.  
- Passwords now securely stored using `bcrypt`.  
- Implemented JWT authentication for secure sessions.  
- Helmet.js added for extra protection via HTTP headers.
